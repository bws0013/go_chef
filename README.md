# go_chef

This is my first attempt at a Golang cookbook. I am starting first with Centos 7 and will move on from there.

This is going to be an almost total rework of the existing Golang Coobook here:
https://github.com/NOX73/chef-golang. It mostly consists of bash blocks. I am going to chef-ify that.

Criticize as you see fit.
